/**
 * Line-oriented capture of everything Marlin transmits on its serial streams.
 *
 * Why this exists: the ImGui Serial Monitor shows recent output to a human, but
 * an agent needs to read back what the firmware said after the fact -- to
 * confirm an `ok`, catch an `Error:` or `//action:` it wasn't watching for, or
 * reconstruct what led to a kill. Scrollback in the UI widget is not reachable
 * programmatically.
 *
 * Retention is a bounded ring of whole lines (default 10,000), grown lazily --
 * nothing is allocated until output actually arrives. When full, the oldest
 * line is dropped and `dropped_lines` counts it, so a reader can tell the
 * difference between "nothing happened" and "you missed some".
 *
 * Every line carries a monotonic sequence number, so an agent polls with
 * ?since=<last_seen> and never re-reads or skips a line.
 *
 * THREADING: append() runs on the simulation thread; queries are served on the
 * server thread (Affinity::Direct). The mutex is what makes that safe, and it
 * is deliberate: the serial log stays readable even when the simulation is
 * frozen (realtime_scale 0) or wedged in a loop -- which is exactly when you
 * most want to see the last thing the firmware printed.
