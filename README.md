# Marlin Simulator

**This is the `cutting-edge` branch, used for new development.** It adds features on
top of `master` that are still being refined, so expect changes and the occasional
rough edge. For a stable simulator use `master`.

MarlinSimUI runs Marlin firmware as a native desktop application, with simulated
steppers, heaters, endstops, displays and SD card, plus a 3D view of the printer.

## Building Marlin with the Simulator

### The easy way: Auto Build Marlin

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the
   [Auto Build Marlin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarlinFirmware.auto-build)
   extension (it installs PlatformIO for you).
2. Get Marlin (`bugfix-2.1.x`) from [GitHub](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin)
   and open the Marlin folder in VS Code.
3. Open Auto Build Marlin and click **Download** to open the Configuration
   Downloader. It backs up your current configuration first.
4. Select the **Simulator** example (type "Simulator" to search). Its
   `MOTHERBOARD` is `BOARD_SIMULATED`.
5. Click **Build** on the `simulator_…` environment for your OS, then **Run**.

### From the command line

Install the system libraries (SDL2, SDL2_net, OpenGL, GLM) listed at the top of
Marlin's `ini/native.ini`. For example:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libglm-dev   # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install gcc@14 glm mesa sdl2 sdl2_net                                     # macOS (Homebrew)
```

Copy the Simulator example from
[Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/bugfix-2.1.x/config/examples/Simulator)
into `Marlin/`, then:

```bash
pio run -e simulator_linux_debug      # or simulator_macos_debug, simulator_windows
./.pio/build/simulator_linux_debug/debug/MarlinSimulator
```

Marlin's `ini/native.ini` fetches this branch
(`MarlinSimUI/archive/cutting-edge.zip`). To build against a local checkout,
point that `lib_deps` line at it:

```ini
MarlinSimUI=symlink:///path/to/MarlinSimUI
```

The simulator saves `eeprom.dat` and `imgui.ini` (window layout) in the directory
it starts from.

## What's new on cutting-edge

### Agent interface (HTTP/JSON)

A local HTTP endpoint lets a script, CI job or AI agent drive the simulator and
read its state. It reports the simulated hardware alongside what Marlin believes,
takes G-code, touches and camera moves, captures screenshots, and can freeze or
speed up simulated time.

```bash
MarlinSimulator --agent-port 8100 --no-audio &

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/ping
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/gcode -d '{"command":"G28"}'
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/idle                        # repeat until "idle":true
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/state/Bed%20Heater
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/screenshot -d '{"path":"/tmp/lcd.png"}'
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/capture/viewport -d '{"path":"/tmp/view.png"}'
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/kernel/control -d '{"realtime_scale":10}'
```

- `POST /gcode` sends to serial stream 3, which Marlin only reads with
  `#define SERIAL_PORT_2 3` enabled in `Configuration.h` (commented out in the
  Simulator example). Without it, commands are accepted and ignored.
- The interface listens on 127.0.0.1 only, and is off unless `--agent-port` is
  given (or `MARLIN_SIM_AGENT_PORT` is set).
- Full reference: [docs/agent-interface.md](docs/agent-interface.md).

Command-line options:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--agent-port <n>` | Enable the agent interface on `127.0.0.1:<n>`. |
| `--serial-port <n>` | TCP port for the raw G-code socket (default 8099). |
| `--no-audio` | Disable buzzer emulation. |
| `--machine <type>` | Viewport printer model: `bedslinger`, `cube` or `delta`. |

### 3D printer models in the Viewport

The Viewport draws a whole printer that moves with the simulation, sized from
your configuration (bed size, Z height, delta geometry).

- **Bedslinger** (i3 style), **Cube** (head on top, bed moves in Z) and **Delta**.
  DELTA builds show the Delta; other builds offer the Bedslinger and the Cube.
  Choose one in the **Printer** menu, with `--machine`, or with `POST /view`.
- **Multiple hotends:** one hotend per `HOTENDS`, placed at its tool offset. The
  model follows `M218`, `M501` and anything else that changes the offsets.
- **Temperature colors:** hotends go from light blue (cold) to pink (at target),
  and the bed from dark blue to dark red. The active hotend glows.
- **Bed markings:** the 0,0 origin (white circle with a cross), the
  `Z_SAFE_HOMING` point (yellow circle with an X), the probeable area (white
  dashed outline, following `M851`), the active tool's reach (light orange
  dashed outline of the software endstops, following the tool and `M218`;
  darker orange when `M211` turns them off) and the leveling mesh grid (light blue).
  Toggle with **Printer > Bed Markings**. On a Delta the reach also includes
  the physical limit of the arms: a solid light orange rounded triangle with its
  corners toward the towers.
- **Printable volume (Delta):** **Printer > Printable Volume** shows a translucent
  volume of where the active tool can print, from the live `M665`/`M666`/`M218`
  geometry. The top is scooped toward each tower, where the carriages reach their
  endstops first.
- **Printer > Show Printer** hides the model, leaving the bed and the print.

### Camera

- **Turntable** (default) orbits a target point. **Fly** is a free camera.
  Switch in **Camera > Mode**.
- Turntable: left-drag to orbit, right-drag, middle-drag or Shift-drag to pan,
  mouse wheel or `+`/`-` to zoom, arrow keys to turn.
- Keys: `1` front, `3` right, `7` top, `0` three-quarter, `F` follow the nozzle,
  `R` reset. In either camera mode, `P` shows/hides the printer, `M` the bed
  markings and `V` the printable volume (Delta).
- Agents can set the view with `POST /view`
  (`{"preset":"iso"}`, `{"yaw":30,"pitch":20,"distance":400}`, `{"machine":"cube"}`,
  `{"markings":false}`).

### Other improvements

- The window opens maximized.
- Better touchscreen tap and drag handling.
- Fixes for building with no LCD, and with `CYRILLIC` characters.
- Panel capture by name: `POST /capture/<panel>` (`lcd`, `viewport`).

## Branches

- `master`: stable.
- `cutting-edge`: new development (this branch).
- `cutting-edge-more-printers`: `cutting-edge` plus a Prusa i3 demo model built
